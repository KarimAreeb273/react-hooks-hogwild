List of things to know!

1. Rendering "cards": This has appeared in pokemon searcher, toy tale, and hogwild so far as the first deliverable. In each of the three labs we created a child component and a grandchild component. In the child component we created a map function to iterate over the array of our objects in db.json. 

Example: 
  const renderHogs = hogs.map((hog) => { 
       return <HogRender key = {hog.name} hog={hog} />
    });

Following creating the map function, we mention our component in child function after the return. 

Example: 
return (
        <div className="ui three stackable cards"> 
        {renderHogs} 
        </div>
    )
